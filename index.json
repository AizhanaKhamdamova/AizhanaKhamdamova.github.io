We publish a list of the 20 most popular options. The list is based on the TIOBE, Google Trends and StackOverflow Trends indexes, languages ​​are in alphabetical order.\n##bash Unix shell scripting, created by Ken Thompson in the early 1970s, is closely related to the C programming language. Bash, an updated Unix shell, was first released in the late 80s and is still under active development. Bash is typically scripted for server configuration, so it’s a good choice for modern cloud environments with containerized storage and microservices. Shell scripts are used quite often, so knowledge of this language is useful. You should also pay attention to zsh, which is currently the default shell in macOS. Applications: server administration, command line interface tools, DevOps, virtualization.\n##COBOL One of the oldest languages ​​still in use today was created by Grace Hopper in the late 1950s and was intended to standardize the development of large-scale business applications on computers. A brilliant concept that is still used today in cross-platform SDKs. An incredible 95% of ATM transactions go through COBOL systems, with many of these devices operating 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Device vendors such as IBM develop more powerful COBOL machines but continue to maintain and upgrade existing systems due to the cost and risk of replacing them. COBOL isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. This is a good choice for those who want to work with clients from the financial sector.\n##C/C++\nThese languages ​​often occupy the top of various ratings - they are valued for their power and speed. C was created in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, C++ was developed by Bjorn Stroustrup in 1985. Today, these two languages ​​underpin everything from operating systems and games to modern scientific computing and machine learning. C and C++ are well suited for demanding applications that value low-level hardware access and performance. Learning these languages ​​takes time and effort. Scope: OS / SDK development, embedded devices, game engines, science. Five programming languages ​​for beginners\nC#, released by Microsoft in 2000, was developed by Anders Hejlsberg as a cross-platform object-oriented programming language. It is now often used to develop business applications, APIs, games, and more. Due to its wide feature set, this language is suitable for graphics and other asynchronous programming tasks. Applications: corporate applications, software and user interface development, games, graphics.\n##Dart\nA modern language developed by Google for building mobile, desktop, web and server applications. Its creator Lars Bak also came up with the JavaSript Engine V8. Dart resembles other modern object-oriented programming languages ​​− C#, TypeScript, and Java - and provides a rich set of features suitable for defining complex interactions, asynchronous operations, animations, and more. Applications: cross-platform applications, cloud services / enterprise systems, games, graphics. Fortran Fortran, developed at IBM in the 1950s by John Backus, is a general-purpose language that was created for scientific and engineering work. It is still widely used for these purposes, including benchmark testing of the world’s fastest supercomputers. It has also been applied in space and physics research and weather modeling. Applications: aerospace/defense, scientific computing, numerical analysis.\n##Java Java is a general-purpose OOP language developed in the 1990s by James Gosling at Sun (now owned by Oracle) and designed to be compiled into bytecode to run on the Java Virtual Machine. By 2020, this includes almost every kind of device, from TVs and game consoles to servers, phones and even kitchen appliances. The language is widely used in corporations and universities, which has made it popular among both novice programmers and experienced developers. Applications: enterprise applications, embedded systems, web services, games.\n##JavaScript JavaScript was developed by Brandon Eich in the 1990s to add scripting to websites. Today it is a universal web interface language with powerful, standardized features that are supported by all major browsers. JavaScript conforms to the EcmaScript standard, which is updated every few years with new language specifications. In addition, JavaScript is often used to develop back-end services and APIs, mobile applications, games, and other software. This is an excellent choice for learning and further improvement. Области применения: фулстэк-разработка, облачные сервисы / контейнерное хранение, игры, утилиты. ##Julia A modern high-level language designed for high-performance numerical processing and statistical analysis. Julia was developed in 2009 by Jeff Besanson, Stefan Karpinski, Viral B. Shah and Alan Edelman. It is one of four languages ​​that can achieve petaflops of …","date":1683504000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1683504000,"objectID":"918c2ae645793b070e27ace951359a94","permalink":"https://aizhanakhamdamova.github.io/post/post5/","publishdate":"2023-05-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/post5/","section":"post","summary":"20 programming languages ​​to learn in 2023","tags":["Academic","开源"],"title":"Programming languages","type":"post"},{"authors":["Khamdamova Aizhana","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Goals for the week Complete all dz in subjects Write a test paper on math analysis Write a report on analytical geometry Pass lab2 in c++ What’s new?

Ведь чипсы – очень популярный продукт, особенно среди молодежи. Родители считают, что эти продукты вредны для нашего организма. Реклама утверждает, что есть эти продукты здорово. Чем же на самом деле вредны эти продукты? ГИПОТЕЗА: Чипсы очень вредны для молодого организма детей. ЦЕЛЬ работы:\nВыяснить историю возникновения чипсов 2.Изучить качественный состав чипсов Проблемы здоровья, вызванные частым употреблением чипсов Задачи работы:\nПроведение опроса для выявления частоты употребления чипсов среди обучающихся детей нашей школы. Проведение опыта на состав и качество 4-х видов чипсов Анализ полученных данных (подтверждение или опровержение гипотезы) Мотивирование (детей и себя) к дальнейшему правильному и здоровому питанию Формирование презентационных навыков и умений (публичное выступление) Введение Тема еды всегда актуальна, поскольку здоровое питание для детей — залог общего здоровья, активности хорошего настроения малыша. Пищевые привычки формируется в детстве, поэтому чрезвычайно важно формировать и прививать нормы здорового питания для детей с самого начала знакомства со взрослой пищей. Чипсы считаются одним из самых популярных продуктов среди молодежи, при этом они неизменно занимают первые места в рейтингах вредных для здоровья человека товаров. В чем причина столь высокого спроса в сочетании с низкими пищевыми качествами этого продукта? ГЛАВА 1. История возникновения чипсов Чипсы были изобретены совершенно случайно. В 1853 году американский бизнесмен Корнелиус Вандербильт решил отобедать в ресторане нью-йоркского отеля «Moon Lake House». Он заказал картофель фри, готовить который для важного гостя взялся шеф-повар Джордж Крам. Привередливый миллионер трижды отсылал на кухню официанта с уже готовыми порциями картофеля: по его мнению, корнеплод всякий раз был нарезан недостаточно тонко. И тогда Джордж Крам, не привыкший к тому, что клиенты жалуются на его стряпню, не выдержал и решил проучить капризного гостя. Повар нарезал картофель тончайшими пластинками и обжарил в масле до хрустящей корочки, посыпал солью и подал в зал. Крам был уверен, что клиент устроит скандал, однако новое блюдо очень понравилось Вандербильту, и миллионер стал часто наведываться в ресторан. Вскоре блюдо распробовали другие посетители. В 1860 году Д. Крам открыл свой ресторан, в котором продавал чипсы, но только не на вынос. Однако, из-за простоты изготовления, чипсы вскоре появились и в других местах. Очень скоро чипсы стали популярны среди американского бомонда и вошли в меню фешенебельных ресторанов США. В 1890 году чипсы сделали шаг из ресторанов на улицу. Популяризатором чипсов стал мелкий торговец из Кливленда Уильям Тэппенден. Он владел закусочной, в которой жарил картофельные ломтики. Кризис, вызванный перепроизводством чипсов, заставил Тэппендена искать новых клиентов. Вскоре была начата продажа этого продукта на улицах Кливленда из украшенного рекламой чипсов старого фургончика. Впервые они подавались покупателям в бумажном кульке, также украшенном рекламой заведения Тэппендена.\nГЛАВА 2. Качественный состав чипсов В основе большинства разновидностей популярного лакомства используется картофель. Данный овощ является довольно полезным. Сам готовый продукт включает множество нужных организму веществ. Но это касается только натуральных несоленых чипсов из картофеля без посторонних добавок. Пищевая ценность поддерживается наличием нутриентов, среди которых присутствуют витамины: C, E, K, группы B. Макроэлементы (мг/100 г): Магний – 67; Калий – 1275; Натрий – 8; Фосфор – 165;\nМикроэлементы: Медь – 306 мкг; Цинк – 1,09 мг; Марганец – 0,44 мг; Селен – 8,1 мкг; Железо – 1,63. Растительные масла — источник незаменимых ненасыщенных жирных кислот - соединений общей формулы CH3(CH2)x(CH=CHCH2)y(CH2)z COOH, где х - 1, 4, 5, 7; у = 1-6; z = 0-7. Молекулы этих веществ имеют цис-конфигурацию, а число атомов углерода в них колеблется от 18 до 24. Первоначально к незаменимым жирным кислотам относили только линолевую и а-линоленовую кислоты, которые в животных организмах не синтезируются, т. е. действительно незаменимые. В дальнейшем к незаменимым жирным кислотам стали относить и другие соединения приведенной формулы, устраняющие симптомы недостаточности жирных кислот, хотя в строгом смысле они не относятся к незаменимым, поскольку могут синтезироваться животными организмами. Кроме того, незаменимые жирные кислоты в некоторой степени предотвращают развитие атеросклероза.\nТоксичные вещества При изготовлении хрустящих ломтиков во время обжарки крахмала образуются целые ряды вредных соединений, поскольку при термической обработке жиров в присутствии кислорода воздуха значительно инициируются процессы их окисления и распада с образованием гидроксикислот, эпоксидов, кетонов и альдегидов. Последние, в свою очередь, могут взаимодействовать дальше с другими различными компонентами …","date":1619481600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619481600,"objectID":"e8f8d235e8e7f2efd912bfe865363fc3","permalink":"https://aizhanakhamdamova.github.io/project/example/","publishdate":"2021-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/example/","section":"project","summary":"Опасный продукт, который дети так любят","tags":["School"],"title":"Индивидуальный учебный проект","type":"project"},{"authors":["Khamdamova Aizhana"],"categories":null,"content":" Create your slides in Markdown - click the Slides button to check out the example.
